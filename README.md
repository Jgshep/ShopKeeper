# ShopKeeper
A simple ShopKeeper Web Application.

Thanks for viewing!

I've created a ShopKeeper web application, using ASP.NET MVC, C#, Entity Framework, and Microsoft SQL Server. The SQL Server Database stores the items, with names and prices. The application uses the Entity Framework to interact with the database, and ASP.NET MVC to display the information on the application.
The application generates a formatted table with the items' information (name, price). Users can edit the item's price, view the item details, or delete the item. 
Users are also able to add new items, with custom names and prices, via the "create new" link above the table. 
All changes will be reflected in the database.
